        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everybody! Welcome to Rhys’s!</p><p>I’m so glad that I finally manage to build my own blog, and I cannot wait to share with you guys all the interesting stuff. It is not easy for me to start writing blogs, since I am not so qualified and still have much to learn. But writing something and sharing and discussing them with others is also an awesome way to learn, isn’t it?</p><p>I really hope that you can get something new from Rhys’s, or just get inspired and come up with some new ideas from things that you’ve been learned about. If you have problems or catch some errors, you can get in touch with me through e-mail. I’m always a listener, a helper and a learner.</p><p>See ya!</p>]]></content>
