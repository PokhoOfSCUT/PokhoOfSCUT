        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>Last time, we talked about several commonly used lighting models in computer graphics. They are experience-based models, creating simple and unreal lighting effects. And this time we are going to learn about a much more realistic rendering technique: <code>PBR, Physically-Based Rendering</code>. It is more or less based on some theories that resembles the physical principles in the real world, but still, it is just an approximation of lighting in the real world. And this is why we call it physically-based rendering instead of physcal rendering. For a PBR lighting model, there are 3 preconditions:</p><ul><li>Microfacet Model</li><li>Energy Conservation</li><li>Physically-based BRDF</li></ul><p>We will go through these one by one.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Microfacet-Model"><a href="#Microfacet-Model" class="headerlink" title="Microfacet Model"></a>Microfacet Model</h2><p>This theory descirbes that any surface at a microscopic scale can be described by tiny little perfectly reflective mirrors called <code>microfacets</code>. According to the roughness of a surface the alignment of these tiny mirrors can differ quite a lot:</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/09de3044e3848c766efa8599711d2e1c.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>The effect of these tiny-like mirror alignments is that when specifically talking about specular lighting/reflection the incoming light rays are more likely to scatter along completely different directions on rougher surfaces, resulting in a more widespread specular reflection. In contrast, on a smooth surface the light rays are more likely to reflect in roughly the same direction, giving us smaller and sharper reflections:</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/0396206cefbf6d01de3e11b896f67549.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>No surface is completely smooth on a microscopic level, but seeing as these microfacets are small enough that we can’t make a distinction between them on a per-pixel basis we statistically approximate the surface’s microfacet roughness given a roughness parameter. Based on the roughness of a surface we can calculate the ratio of microfacets roughly aligned to some vector $\vec h$. This vector $\vec h$ is the halfway vector that sits halfway between the light $\vec l$ and view $\vec v$ vector. We’ve discussed the halfway vector before in the blinn-phong lighting model which is calculated as the sum of $\vec l$ and $\vec v$ divided by its length:</p><p>$$ \vec h = \frac{\vec l + \vec v}{|\vec l + \vec v|} $$</p><p>The more the microfacets are aligned to the halfway vector, the sharper and stronger the specular reflection. Together with a roughness parameter that varies between 0 and 1 we can statistically approximate the alignment of the microfacets.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/853b7d94518429f935bedd650787edde.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Energy-Conservation"><a href="#Energy-Conservation" class="headerlink" title="Energy Conservation"></a>Energy Conservation</h2><p>Energy conservation describes that the energy of outgoing light rays never exceed that of the incoming light rays. As we can see in the picture above, as the roughness inceases,  the area of reflectance increases but the brightness goes down.</p><p>For energy conservation to hold we need to make a clear distinction between diffuse and specular light. We’ve covered this last time when we talked about the scattering. When a light ray hits a surface, it breaks into a reflection part and a refraction part. The reflection part is the part that doesn’t go inside the object, which we call specular specular lighting. While the refraction part goes under the surface and is partially absorbed, which we call diffuse lighting.</p><p>Physically, we are going to have a deeper look at the “<strong>partial absorption</strong>“. A light ray can be regarded as a beam of energy that keeps moving forward until it loses all its energy, and it loses its energy by colliding with other molecules. All materials consist of innumerable tiny molecules, and these molecules absorb all or part of a light ray’s energy when they collide and turn them into heat. Generally, not all energy is absorbed, and the light ray keeps moving until the energy is totally aborbed or finds another way out the surface. If the light ray is not completely absorbed and finally moves out, it participates in forming the surface’s color, and this is what we call diffuse color.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/b4d7351fbb1870822d5417c6f0904e7e.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>Furthermore, for metallic materials, all refracted lights are completely absorbed and not rescattered out of the surface. So, metallica materials don’t dispaly a diffuse color.</p><p>Based on the distinction between the reflection and refraction, we can conclude that the reflected light and the refracted light are mutually exclusive. We can calculate the total energy of reflected light and the rest goes to refracted light.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Reflectance-Equation"><a href="#Reflectance-Equation" class="headerlink" title="Reflectance Equation"></a>Reflectance Equation</h2><p>To thoroughly understand the reflectance equation, we have to involve a little bit of <strong>Radiometry</strong>.</p><p>$$ L_o(p,\ w_o) = \int_{\Omega}^{ }{f_r(p,\ w_i,\ w_o)L_i(p,\ w_i)n \cdot w_idw_i} $$</p><p>This does look very scary at the beginning, but as we gradually analyze it, I believe we will figure it out. We go through some terms first.</p><p><strong>Radiant flux</strong>: radiant flux $\Phi$ is the transmitted energy of a light source measured in Watts. Light is a collective sum of energy over multiple different wavelengths, each wavelength associated with a particular visible color. The emitted energy of a light source are therefore be thought of as a function of all its different wavelengths. The radiant flux measures the total area of this function of different wavelengths. Directly taking this measure of wavelengths as input in computer graphics is slightly impractical so we often make the simplification of representing radiant flux not as a function of varing wavelength strengths, but as a light color triplet encoded as RGB. This encoding does come at quite a loss of information, but this is generally negligible for visual aspects.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/f86e5a1db8ebf85f091819e37fc6af19.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p><strong>Solid angle</strong>: solid angle is represented by $\omega$, describing the size or area of a shape projected onto a unit sphere. The area of the projected shape onto this unit sphere is known as the <code>solid angle</code>. You can visualize the solid angle as a direction with volume:</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/7e0c3e88ed6b9447de5fcb44d075320e.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>Thinking of being an observer at the center of this unit sphere and looking in the direction of the shape, and the size of the silhouette you make out of it is the solid angle.</p><p><strong>Radiant intensity</strong>: radiant intensity measures the amount of radiant flux per solid angle or the strength of a light source over a projected area onto the unit sphere. For instance, given an omnidirectional light that radiates equally in all directions the radiant intensity can give us its energy over a specific area:</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/d3dc7234c156a8ac9e40f48f0e57d1a3.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>The equation to describe the radiant intensity is defined as follows:</p><p>$$ I = \frac{d\Phi}{d\omega} $$</p><p>Where $I$ is the radiant flux $\Phi$ over the solid angle $\omega$.</p><p>With knowledge of radiant flux, radiant intensity and the solid angle we can finally describe the equation for radiance, which is described as the total observed energy over an area $A$ over the solid angle $\omega$ of a light of radiant intensity $\Phi$:</p><p>$$ L = \frac{d^2\Phi}{dAdwcos\theta} $$</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/e6337d3182318a194fa1109251dbf9d9.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>If we consider the solid angle $\omega$ and the area $A$ to be infinitely small, we can us radiance to measure the flux of a single ray of light hitting a single point. This relation allows us to calculate the radiance of a single light ray influencing a single fragment. We effectively translate the solid angle $\omega$ into a direction vector $\omega$, and $A$ into a point $p$. This way we can directly use radiance in our shaders to calculate a single light ray’s per-fragment contribution.</p><p>In fact, when it comes to radiance we generally care about all incoming light onto a point p which is the sum of all radiance known as irradiance. With knowledge of both radiance and <code>irradiance</code> we can get back to the reflectance equation:</p><p>$$ L_o(p,\ w_o) = \int_{\Omega}^{ }{f_r(p,\ w_i,\ w_o)L_i(p,\ w_i)n \cdot w_idw_i} $$</p><p>We now know that L in the render equation represents the radiance of some point p and some incoming infinitely small solid angle ωi which can be thought of as an incoming direction vector $ω_i$. Remember that $cos\theta$ scales the energy based on the light’s incident angle to the surface which we find in the reflectance equation as $n\cdot ω_i$. The reflectance equation calculates the sum of reflected radiance $L_o(p,\ ω_o)$ of a point $p$ in direction $ω_o$ which is the outgoing direction to the viewer. Or to put it differently: $L_o$ measures the reflected sum of the lights’ irradiance onto point $p$ as viewed from $ω_o$.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="BRDF"><a href="#BRDF" class="headerlink" title="BRDF"></a>BRDF</h2><p>The <code>BRDF</code>, or <code>bidirectional reflective distribution function</code> is a function that takes as input the incoming light direction $w_i$, the outgoing view direction $w_o$, the surface normal $n$ and a surface parameter $a$ that represents the microsuface’s roughness. The BRDF approximates how much each individual light ray ωi contributes to the final reflected light of an opaque surface given its material properties.</p><p>A BRDF approximates the material’s reflective and refractive properties based on the previously discussed microfacet theory. For a BRDF to be physically plausible it has to respect the law of energy conservation i.e. the sum of reflected light should never exceed the amount of incoming light. Technically, Blinn-Phong is considered a BRDF taking the same ωi and ωo as inputs. However, Blinn-Phong is not considered physically based as it doesn’t adhere to the energy conservation principle. There are several physically based BRDFs out there to approximate the surface’s reaction to light. However, almost all real-time render pipelines use a BRDF known as the <code>Cook-Torrance BRDF</code>.</p><p>The Cook-Torrance BRDF contains both a diffuse and specular part:</p><p>$$ f_r = k_df_{lambert} + k_sf_{cook-torrance} $$</p><p>Here $k_d$ is the earlier mentioned ratio of incoming light energy that gets refracted with $k_s$ being the ratio that gets reflected. The left side of the BRDF states the diffuse part of the equation denoted here as $f_{lambert}$. This is known as <code>lambertian diffuse</code> similar to what we used for diffuse shading which is a constant factor denoted as:</p><p>$$ f_{lambert} = \frac{c}{\pi} $$</p><p>With $c$ being the albedo or surface color (think of the diffuse surface texture). The divide by $\pi$ is there to normalize the diffuse light as the earlier denoted integral that contains the BRDF is scaled by $\pi$.</p><blockquote><p>Notice:<br>You might wonder how this Lambertian diffuse relates to the diffuse term we’ve been using before: the surface color multiplied by the dot product between the surface’s normal and the light direction. The dot product is still there, but moved out of the BRDF as we find $n\cdot ω_i$ at the end of the $L_o$ integral.</p></blockquote><p>There exist different equations for the diffuse part of the BRDF which tend to look more realistic, but are also more computationally expensive. As concluded by Epic Games however, the Lambertian diffuse is sufficient enough for most real-time rendering purposes.</p><p>The specular part of the BRDF is a bit more advanced and is described as:</p><p>$$ f_{cook-torrance} = \frac{DFG}{4(w_o\cdot n)(w_i\cdot n)} $$</p><p>The Cook-Torrance specular BRDF consists of three functions and a normalization factor in the denominator. Each of the D, F and G symbols represent a type of function that approximates a specific part of the surface’s reflective properties. These are defined as the normal <strong>D</strong>istribution function, the <strong>F</strong>resnel equation and the <strong>G</strong>eometry function:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Normal distribution function</strong>: approximates the amount of the surface’s microfacets are aligned to the halfway vector influenced by the roughness of the surface; this is the primary function approximating the microfacets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Geometry function</strong>: describes the self-shadowing property of the microfacets. When a surface is relatively rough the surface’s microfacets can overshadow other microfacets thereby reducing the light the surface reflects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fresnel equation</strong>: the Fresnel equation describes the ratio of surface reflection at different surface angles.</p></li></ul><p>Each of these functions is an approximation of their physics equivalents and you’ll find more than one version of each one that aims to approximate the underlying physics; some more realistic, others more efficient. It is perfectly allowed to pick whatever approximated version of these functions you want to use. Brian Karis from Epic Games did a good deal of research on the multiple types of approximations here. We’re going to pick the same functions used by Epic Game’s Unreal Engine 4 which are the Trowbridge-Reitz GGX for D, the Fresnel-Schlick approximation for F and the Smith’s Schlick-GGX for G.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Normal-Distribution-Function"><a href="#Normal-Distribution-Function" class="headerlink" title="Normal Distribution Function"></a>Normal Distribution Function</h3><p>The normal distribution function D statistically approximates the relative surface area of microfacets exactly aligned to the halfway vector h. There are a multitude of NDFs defined that statistically approximate the general alignment of the microfacets given some roughness parameter and the one we’ll be using is known as the Trowbridge-Reitz GGX:</p><p>$$ NDF_{GGXTR}(n,\ h,\ \alpha) = \frac{\alpha^2}{\pi((n\cdot h)^2(\alpha^2 - 1) + 1)^2} $$</p><p>Here $h$ is the halfway vector to measure against the surface’s microfacets, with $\alpha$ being a measure of the surface’s roughness. If we take $h$ as the halfway vector between the surface normal and light direction over varying roughness parameters we get the following visual result:</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/853b7d94518429f935bedd650787edde.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Geometry-Function"><a href="#Geometry-Function" class="headerlink" title="Geometry Function"></a>Geometry Function</h3><p>The geometry function statistically approximates the relative surface area where its micro surface-details overshadow each other causing light rays to be occluded.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/a45ac0bdf558d97dfeaf37208dc39d18.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>Similar to the NDF, the Geometry function takes a material’s roughness parameter as input with rougher surfaces having a higher probability of overshadowing microfacets. The geometry function we will use is a combination of the GGX and Schlick-Beckmann approximation known as Schlick-GGX:</p><p>$$ G_{SchlickGGX}(n,\ v,\ k) = \frac{n\cdot v}{(n\cdot v)(1 - k) + k} $$</p><p>Here $k$ is a remapping of $\alpha$ based on whether we’re using the geometry function for either direct lighting or IBL lighting:</p><p>$$ k_{direct} = \frac{(\alpha + 1)^2}{8} $$</p><p>$$ k_{IBL} = \frac{\alpha^2}{2}$$</p><p>To effectively approximate the geometry we need to take account of both the view direction and the light direction vector. We can take both into account using <code>Smith&#39;s method</code>:</p><p>$$G(n,\ v,\ l,\ k) = G_{SchlickGGX}(n,\ v,\ k)G_{SchlickGGX}(n,\ l,\ k)$$</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/25a799dfa08709cb908ce0d269af2c85.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>The geometry function is a multiplier between $[0.0, 1.0]$ with white or $1.0$ measuring no microfacet shadowing and black or $0.0$ complete microfacet shadowing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Fresnel-Equation"><a href="#Fresnel-Equation" class="headerlink" title="Fresnel Equation"></a>Fresnel Equation</h3><p>The Fresnel equation describes the ratio of light that gets reflected over the light that gets refracted, which varies over the angle we’re looking at a surface. The moment light hits a surface, based on the surface to view angle the Fresnel equation tells us the percentage of light that gets reflected. From this ratio of reflection and the energy conservation principle we can directly obtain the refracted portion of light from its remaining energy.</p><p>Every surface or material has a level of base <code>reflectivity</code> when looking straight at its surface, but when looking at the surface from an angle all reflections become more apparent compared to the surface’s base reflectivity. You can check this for yourself by looking at your presumably wooden/metallic desk which has a certain level of base reflectivity from a perpendicular view angle, but by looking at your desk from an almost 90 degree angle you’ll see the reflections become much more apparent. All surfaces theoretically fully reflect light if seen from perfect 90-degree angles. This phenomenon is known as <code>Fresnel</code> and is described by the Fresnel equation.</p><p>The Fresnel equation is a rather complex equation, but luckily the Fresnel equation can be approximated using the Fresnel-Schlick approximation:</p><p>$$ F_{Schlick}(h,\ v,\ F_0) = F_0 + (1 - F_0)(1 - (h\cdot v))^5 $$</p><p>$F_0$ represents the base reflectivity of the surface, which we calculate using something called the indices of refraction or IOR and as you can see on a sphere surface, the more we look towards the surface’s grazing angles the stronger the Fresnel and thus the reflections:</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/26/72c18072ac770568970d7a677dfe4e71.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>There are a few subtleties involved with the Fresnel equation. One is that the Fresnel-Schlick approximation is only really defined for dielectric or non-metal surfaces. For conductor surfaces, calculating the base reflectivity using their indices of refraction doesn’t properly hold and we need to use a different Fresnel equation for conductors altogether. As this is inconvenient we further approximate by pre-computing the surface’s response at normal incidence, at a 0 degree angle as if looking directly onto a surface, and interpolate this value based on the view angle as per the Fresnel-Schlick approximation such that we can use the same equation for both metals and non-metals.</p><pre class=" language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp">vec3 F0 <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">vec3</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">0.04</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>F0 <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">mix</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>F0<span class="token punctuation">,</span> surfaceColor<span class="token punctuation">.</span>rgb<span class="token punctuation">,</span> metalness<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Cook-Torrance-Reflectance-Equation"><a href="#Cook-Torrance-Reflectance-Equation" class="headerlink" title="Cook-Torrance Reflectance Equation"></a>Cook-Torrance Reflectance Equation</h2><p>With every component of the Cook-Torrance BRDF described we can include the physically based BRDF into the now final reflectance equation:</p><p>$$L_o(p,\ w_o) = \int_{\Omega}^{ }{(k_d\frac{c}{\pi} + k_s\frac{DFG}{4(w_o\cdot n)(w_i\cdot n)})L_i(p,\ w_i)n\cdot w_idw_i}$$</p><p>This equation is however not fully mathematically correct. You may remember that the Fresnel term $F$ represents the ratio of light that gets reflected on a surface. This is effectively our ratio $k_s$, meaning the specular part of the reflectance equation implicitly contains the reflectance ratio $k_s$. Given this, our final final reflectance equation becomes:</p><p>$$L_o(p,\ w_o) = \int_{\Omega}^{ }{(k_d\frac{c}{\pi} + \frac{DFG}{4(w_o\cdot n)(w_i\cdot n)})L_i(p,\ w_i)n\cdot w_idw_i}$$</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h2><p>[1] <a href="https://learnopengl.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LearnOpenGL</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-We-Perceive-Colors"><a href="#How-We-Perceive-Colors" class="headerlink" title="How We Perceive Colors"></a>How We Perceive Colors</h2><p>Physically, lights propagate in media as the form of waves. This is supported by the <strong>Young’s Double-Slit Interference Experiment</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>For more information, you can check it out <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicstestbook2/chapter/youngs-double-slit-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p></blockquote><p>As waves, they have unique wavelengths. The lights we can see with naked eyes, the visible lights, have wavelengths within the range from $380\ nm$ to $780\ nm$.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/19/88594962adbb74e75bd95a40b5bafe09.jpg" alt></p><p>An opaque object can reflect and absorb lights of specific wavelengths. Simply, if it reflects green lights, wavelengths of around $500\ nm$, and absorb any other lights, the object looks greenish. Similarly, a red object reflects most of the red lights and absorbs other lights. More specially, a white object reflects all visible lights while a black one absorb most of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Light-Source"><a href="#Light-Source" class="headerlink" title="Light Source"></a>Light Source</h3><p>Lights don’t just come from nowhere, they are generated by light sources, like the sun or light bulbs. In a rendering system, we regard a light source as a single point without volume. And we use different vectors to present different light directions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Scattering-and-Absorption"><a href="#Scattering-and-Absorption" class="headerlink" title="Scattering and Absorption"></a>Scattering and Absorption</h3><p>When a light ray hit an object, scattering and absorption happen.</p><p>Scatter only changes the light’s direction whil absorption only has its impact on light’s density and color. When a light ray is scattered, it breaks into two parts: one is scattered outward, which is called <strong>reflection</strong>, the other is scattered inward which is called <strong>refraction</strong>. For an opaque object, the refracted light ray will bounce between the molecules inside the object and go out in another place. This kind of emergent light ray holds different direction and color to the incident light ray.</p><p>To distinguish these two emergent light rays, we use different method to simulate them in a lighting model. We use <strong>Specular</strong> to indicate how an object reflects light, and use <strong>Diffuse</strong> to how many lights are refracted and rescattered out of the object.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Shading"><a href="#Shading" class="headerlink" title="Shading"></a>Shading</h3><p>Shading is to figure out the <strong>exitance</strong> in a specific viewing direction with an euqation based on material properties and lighting information. The equation is also called <strong>Lighting Model</strong>.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Standard-Lighting-Model"><a href="#Standard-Lighting-Model" class="headerlink" title="Standard Lighting Model"></a>Standard Lighting Model</h2><p>In a standard lighting model which is nonphysical, we take 4 ingredients that contribute to shading. <strong>Emissive</strong>, <strong>Diffuse</strong>, <strong>Specular</strong>, and <strong>Ambient</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>Emissive: indicates how many lights this object itself will emit in a given direction. Notice that without GI, this kind of emissive lights won’t shed any lights on the environment. It just makes itself look glowing.</p></li><li><p>Ambient: simulates the indirect lights, and it is constant for simplicity.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Lambert-Lighting-Model"><a href="#Lambert-Lighting-Model" class="headerlink" title="Lambert Lighting Model"></a>Lambert Lighting Model</h3><p>Lambert lighting model is a simple and common way to simulate diffuse color of a rough surface. It is experience-based, depending on the fragment normal and the light direction.</p><p>$$ Diffuse = k_d \times Color \times LightColor \times max(0,\ \vec N \cdot \vec V_{light}) $$</p><p>The $k_d$ is a constant describing the object’s diffuse property.</p><p>$$ Ambient = k_d \times AmbientColor $$</p><p>And the final lamber lighting model is:</p><p>$$ Diffuse + Ambient $$</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Half-Lambert-Lighting-Model"><a href="#Half-Lambert-Lighting-Model" class="headerlink" title="Half Lambert Lighting Model"></a>Half Lambert Lighting Model</h3><p>Half lambert lighting is innovated by Valve Corporation when they were developing game <strong>Half Life</strong>. In a dark environment where the diffuse light is weak or the diffuse light is hard to reach, the dot product can be negative. And with the $max$ operation, the dot product remains 0, which means the object’s diffuse color is very dark.</p><p>It is absolutely bad for a game, making player hard to see things in the dark. So Valve substituted a new equation for the former one:</p><p>$$ Diffuse = k_d \times Color \times LightColor \times ((\vec N \cdot \vec V_{light}) \times 0.5 + 0.5) $$</p><p>It maps the dot product onto $[0,\ 1]$ instead of $[-1,\ 1]$, and successfully solves the problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Phong-Lighting-Model"><a href="#Phong-Lighting-Model" class="headerlink" title="Phong Lighting Model"></a>Phong Lighting Model</h3><p>For a piece of paper or a wood log in a simple project, lambert or half lambert can be a good choice which is simple and effcient. However, when it comes to metalls, glasses, or any other reflecting material, they start to be unreal. Because these materials shows specular effects in some ways. If you’d ever observed some materials’ reflections, you would have seen an area filled with intensive white light which makes you hard to see the object’s original color.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>Last time, we’ve talked about what a surface shader is, and what ingredients assemble a surface shader. And this time, we are going to put it into use to learn about making some simple effects. Before this, let’s go through some fundamental concepts of basic lighting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Ambient-Lighting"><a href="#Ambient-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Ambient Lighting"></a>Ambient Lighting</h3><p>In the real world, even when you’re in a dark environment with no lights on, the objects around you may not look completely dark. This is because there are always some lights from far away in the real world, like moon or some distant lights. To simulate this, we have to give an object an <strong>constant</strong> ambient color. However, this is just a simple simulation which doesn’t take into account the bounce of lights. Actually, when a light beam hits an object, it breaks into three parts:</p><ul><li>One is directly reflected by the object. </li><li>Another penetrates into the object and bounces between the molecules inside, and finally finds another way out.</li><li>The last penetrates into the object and its energy is exhausted while bouncing, and is ultimately absorbed.</li></ul><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/19/7de14d1ec0db67fda1a9f760bae9000f.png" alt></p><p>I defintely dont’t want to  get deep into physics, so I only offer these simplified statements based on my understanding. The lighting model includes these is what we call <code>Global Illumination</code>, which is way beyond our range.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Diffuse-Lighting"><a href="#Diffuse-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Diffuse Lighting"></a>Diffuse Lighting</h3><p>Simply saying, the diffuse lighting gives an object a color that is mixed by the object basic color and light color. In the picture above, it is the second type of subdivisions. The intensity of diffuse lighting, seemingly the brightness of the color, is affected by the angle between the fragment’s normal vector and the light ray vector.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/19/9521185f58016300a424271b086accf5.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>The commonsense is that the smaller the angle is, the brighter the color is. How should we do to measure the angle? Here we apply the dot product of the normalized versions of these two vectors. The lighting equation will look like this:</p><p>$$ Diffuse = BasicColor \times (\vec N \cdot \vec V_{light}) \times LightColor  $$</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Specular-Lighting"><a href="#Specular-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Specular Lighting"></a>Specular Lighting</h3><!--Think about this: it's a sunny day, you stand by the side of a lake. What does the lake surface look like with intensive sunlight casted on it? It depends on what angle you look at it from. If you look down to the water right by your side, it must be very clear; if you look at the water far away from you, it looks reflective and shiny. This is called `Fresnel Reflection`.--><!--![](https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/19/f5a0961121b9ac7b32258821541a9ab7.jpg)--><p>Specular lighting generates a highlight at where the light ray is reflected. Like diffuse lighting, it also depends on fragment normal and the light ray vector, more directly the reflected light vector. Additionally, it involves a viewing vector.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/19/f9526b2dd82e4777f9af3e99af423fc7.png" alt title="From LearnOpenGL.com"></p><p>The specular light equation will look like this:</p><p>$$ Specular = K_s \times LightColor \times (\vec V_{view} \cdot \vec V_{reflected})^{shininess} $$</p><blockquote><p>This is used in a lighting model called <code>Phong</code>. There is another optimized version called <code>Blinn-Phong</code> which differs a little. We will be talking about them in another article concerning variable lightings.</p></blockquote><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Our-First-Shader"><a href="#Our-First-Shader" class="headerlink" title="Our First Shader"></a>Our First Shader</h2><p>Now let’s get our hands moving!</p><ul><li>Create a standard surface shader.</li><li>Define some properties we need.</li></ul><pre class=" language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp">Properties <span class="token punctuation">{</span>    <span class="token function">_Color</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Color"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> Color<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>    <span class="token function">_AmbientColor</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Ambient Color"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> Color<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>    <span class="token function">_Smoothness</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Smoothness"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token function">Range</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0.5</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>Subshader <span class="token punctuation">{</span>    CGPROGRAM    float4 _Color<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    float4 _AmbientColor<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    half _Smoothness<span class="token punctuation">;</span>  <span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">// This is the way Unity calls the "shininess"</span>    ENDCG<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><ul><li>Modify the surface funtion.</li></ul><pre class=" language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp"><span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">surf</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>Input IN<span class="token punctuation">,</span> inout SurfaceOutputStandard o<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>    fixed4 c <span class="token operator">=</span> _Color <span class="token operator">+</span> _AmbientColor<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    o<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Albedo <span class="token operator">=</span> c<span class="token punctuation">.</span>rgb<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    o<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Smoothness <span class="token operator">=</span> _Smoothness<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    o<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Alpha <span class="token operator">=</span> c<span class="token punctuation">.</span>a<span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>Now we can see some cool staff!

It needs some extra modules to be attached to it to make itself functional. We call these modules <code>components</code>. Now you’ve been using Unity, you must have known some of them, like a <code>Transform</code> component which is required for every game object. If you want to see a solid object, a <code>MeshFilter</code> component and a <code>MeshRenderer</code> component are required. A mesh filter is used to manage the mesh or, we can say, the model of the game object, and it can be more than 1. A mesh renderer is used to manage the materials for each mesh in the mesh filter. Every material has its own shader, and this is what we are going to talk about.</p><blockquote><p>Notice:<br>The number of materials in a mesh renderer can be more than that of meshes in a mesh filter, but make sure you never do this. It is conpletely unnecessary, and won’t enhance the expression and cost more in performance.</p></blockquote><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Make-Acquaintance"><a href="#Make-Acquaintance" class="headerlink" title="Make Acquaintance"></a>Make Acquaintance</h2><p>Let’s finish some preparatory works first.</p><ul><li>Right click and select <strong>Create | Folder</strong> and rename it <strong>Shaders</strong>.</li><li>Likewise, create another two folders and rename them <strong>Materials</strong> and <strong>Textures</strong> respectively.</li><li>In the <strong>Shaders</strong>, right click and select <strong>Create | Shader | Standard Surface Shader</strong> and rename it whatever you want.</li><li>Open the shader file.</li></ul><p>And you can see something like below:</p><pre class=" language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp">Shader <span class="token string">"Custom/FirstShader"</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>    Properties    <span class="token punctuation">{</span>        <span class="token function">_Color</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Color"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> Color<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>        <span class="token function">_MainTex</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Albedo (RGB)"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> 2D<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"white"</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>        <span class="token function">_Glossiness</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Smoothness"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token function">Range</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0.5</span>        <span class="token function">_Metallic</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Metallic"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token function">Range</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0.0</span>    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>    SubShader    <span class="token punctuation">{</span>        Tags <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token string">"RenderType"</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"Opaque"</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span>        LOD <span class="token number">200</span>        CGPROGRAM        <span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">// Physically based Standard lighting model, and enable shadows on all light types</span>        <span class="token macro property">#<span class="token directive keyword">pragma</span> surface surf Standard fullforwardshadows</span>        <span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">// Use shader model 3.0 target, to get nicer looking lighting</span>        <span class="token macro property">#<span class="token directive keyword">pragma</span> target 3.0</span>        sampler2D _MainTex<span class="token punctuation">;</span>        <span class="token keyword">struct</span> Input        <span class="token punctuation">{</span>            float2 uv_MainTex<span class="token punctuation">;</span>        <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>        half _Glossiness<span class="token punctuation">;</span>        half _Metallic<span class="token punctuation">;</span>        fixed4 _Color<span class="token punctuation">;</span>        <span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">// Add instancing support for this shader.

Notice that no <code>;</code> at the end of a property item. To learn more about the property, you can check <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Properties.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p></li></ul><ul><li><code>Subshader</code> is the functional part of a shader. You can set up the <code>Tags</code> and <code>LOD</code>, and you can define some <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Pass.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pass</a>. Those in the <code>CGPROGRAM-ENDCG</code> block are the real CG code which we mainly focus on, responsible for calculations. A shader can have more than one subshaders, and it will always pick the first one to perform the task. If the first one is not supported, then the second one, the third one, and finally the fallback.</li></ul><p>This is pretty much the general structure of a surface shader. Now, we shift our attention onto the code in the <code>CGPROGRAM-ENDCG</code> block.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="CG-Program"><a href="#CG-Program" class="headerlink" title="CG Program"></a>CG Program</h2><p>If you learned about OpenGL or rendering pipline, you could have known that we spend most of our time with the <code>vertex shader</code> and <code>fragment shader</code> when we do rendering. You can also use them to perform rendering tasks instead of using surface shader. We’ve talked about <code>Pass</code> just now. In Unity shader, if you deal with vertex shader and fragment shader, you should put them in a pass. For each pass, rendering is performed once, using the vertex and fragment shaders inside.</p><pre class=" language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp">SubShader<span class="token punctuation">{</span>    Pass    <span class="token punctuation">{</span>        CGPROGRAM        <span class="token macro property">#<span class="token directive keyword">pragma</span> vertex vert</span>        <span class="token macro property">#<span class="token directive keyword">pragma</span> fragment frag</span>        <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>        ENDCG    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>What about surface shader? Actually, surface shader is a kind of capsulation of vertex and fragment shaders. In a vertex shader, you have to tranform the vertices from local space into the clip space manually. In a fragment shader, you have to define a light model, which involves a lot of mathematic and physics staff. It’s no doubt a complicated job to do. However, with surface shader, you just tell Unity what color it is, which texture to use, which light model to apply, etc. And Unity does all the rest for you!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Surface-Function"><a href="#Surface-Function" class="headerlink" title="Surface Function"></a>Surface Function</h3><pre class=" language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp"><span class="token macro property">#<span class="token directive keyword">pragma</span> surface surf Standard fullforwardshadows </span><span class="token keyword">struct</span> Input<span class="token punctuation">{</span>    float2 uv_MainTex<span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">surf</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>Input IN<span class="token punctuation">,</span> inout SurfaceOutputStandard o<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>    <span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">// Albedo comes from a texture tinted by color</span>    fixed4 c <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">tex2D</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>_MainTex<span class="token punctuation">,</span> IN<span class="token punctuation">.</span>uv_MainTex<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">*</span> _Color<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    o<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Albedo <span class="token operator">=</span> c<span class="token punctuation">.</span>rgb<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    <span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">// Metallic and smoothness come from slider variables</span>    o<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Metallic <span class="token operator">=</span> _Metallic<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    o<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Smoothness <span class="token operator">=</span> _Glossiness<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    o<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Alpha <span class="token operator">=</span> c<span class="token punctuation">.</span>a<span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>The first line is a declaration of a surface function. The <code>surface</code> indicates that it is a surface shader function. The <code>surf</code> is the function name which you can rename. The <code>Standard</code> is a build-in light model being used. The <code>fullforwardShadows</code> is a optional setup.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Source-of-Data"><a href="#Source-of-Data" class="headerlink" title="Source of Data"></a>Source of Data</h3><p>The <code>Input</code> struct is the source of the data.

So, we need another struct to store the results. Unity provides 3 different structs for different light models: <code>SurfaceOutput</code>, <code>SurfaceOutputStandard</code>, and <code>SurfaceOutputStandardSpecular</code>. The first one is for some simple nonphysical light model, like <strong>Lambert</strong> and <strong>Blinnphong</strong>. Another two are for the PBR light model.</p><pre class=" language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp"><span class="token keyword">struct</span> SurfaceOutput <span class="token punctuation">{</span>    fixed3 Albedo<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    fixed3 Normal<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    fixed3 Emission<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    half Specular<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    fixed Gloss<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    fixed Alpha<span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token keyword">struct</span> SurfaceOutputStandard <span class="token punctuation">{</span>    fixed3 Albedo<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    fixed3 Normal<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    half3 Emission<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    half Metallic<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    half Smoothness<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    half Occlusion<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    fixed Alpha<span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token keyword">struct</span> SurfaceOutputStandardSpecular <span class="token punctuation">{</span>    fixed3 Albedo<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    fixed3 Normal<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    half3 Emission<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    half Specular<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    half Smoothness<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    half Occlusion<span class="token punctuation">;</span>    fixed Alpha<span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We went through the general structure of a standard surface shader, and talked about every ingredients of it.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>You may have heard of <code>binary search</code>. If you are searching for an item among an sorted array using binary search, it starts with checking the equality of the search value $K$ and the middle value of the array $K_m$. If they equal, the processing immediately stops. If the $K &gt; K_m$, then it goes to check the equality of the $K$ and the middle value among the subarray consisting of all the item on the right of the $K_m$, or on the left for the case $K &lt; K_m$. And keep doing this until the match is found.</p><blockquote><p>Notice:<br>A significant thing here is that the array on which the binary search is performed must be sorted, whatever ascendingly or descendingly.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s get back and focus on binary tree. You’ve known that it consists of a root node, a left child node, and a right childe node. If the contents in these nodes have a specific relationship in magnitude, for example, $K_l &lt; K_r \leq K_r$, it is just like a sorted array in a binary tree form. By a relationship like this, we come up with a binary tree on which a binary search can be performed, and it is called <code>binary search tree</code>.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/11/189619d051e0e73cb50fd29de2026d59.png" alt title="Binary Search Tree"></p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Binary-Search-Tree"><a href="#Binary-Search-Tree" class="headerlink" title="Binary Search Tree"></a>Binary Search Tree</h2><p>We defined a tree node structure last time, and we are going to use it to finish the binary search tree class. In the definition of the node class, we applied <code>template</code>. And in that template are two types of parameter: one for search key, the other for the contents of data. Applying a search key is important, because in some cases, the data structure we aim to process can be complicated, like a staff including an ID, a name, an age, a phone number, a vocation, an address, etc. In most cases, we don’t know all of them precisely, if we do, we don’t have to search for it. So we can make the ID a search key, and find the match to get all the rest. Since the binary tree is organized by magnitude, the search keys have to be comparable.</p><p>Say that we are making a game, and there are bunch of weapons in the game. Each weapon has its own ID, name, and damage. Here we take the ID as a search key.</p><pre class=" language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp"><span class="token keyword">struct</span> Weapon<span class="token punctuation">{</span>    <span

title="Deletion"></a>Deletion</h3><p>Deletion of a node is much more complicated. If a node only has a left child or a right child, we can replace it with the left child or the right child when it is removed. However, the situation will be more sophisticated when a node to be deleted has two children and even the children have their own children. In this case, we cannot simply replace it, we also have to reconstruct the subtree to make them put on correct positions to meet the binary tree requirement.</p><p>Let’s take a look at this case:</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/11/2c77382ecac4f11bdd641744b33f6f89.png" alt></p><p>We are going to delete the node containing $67$. How can we reconstruct the subtree whose root node is $67$, a node waiting to be removed? Let’s first make this clear: a subtree formed by certain nodes can be very different. So here are two solutions:</p><ol><li>Replace the node with the most left node in its right subtree.</li><li>Replace the node with the most right node in its left subtree.</li></ol><p>Here, we use the first solution, and process and result are presented in the picture above. If you choose the second one, you should replace the $67$ with the $59$, and set its right child to $79$. Now let’s take a further look, what if the most left node has a right child?</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/11/7828d7ef5f6238f71e8c1c3b45532117.png" alt></p><p>As a matter of fact, it won’t make much difference. In the case above, we assign the deleted node’s parent, left child, and right child to the replacing node. And in this case, for the deleted node’s right child we perform a insertion: insert it into the subtree taking the replacing node as its root. The insertion will automatically put the right child to the correct position. Like what’s presented in the picture above, the $79$ is automatically set as $77$ right child. Should we perform a insertion on the left child of the deleted node? The answer is absolutely no, we don’t have to do that. Because we choose the most left childe node of the deleted node’s right subtree as the replacing node, a most left node has no left child, so we can simply assign.</p><pre class=" language-cpp"><code

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>A <code>binary tree</code> is made up of a finite set of elements called <code>nodes</code>. This set either is empty or consists of a node called the <code>root</code> together with two binary trees, called the left and right <code>subtrees</code>. The roots of these subtrees are childeren of the root.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/08/6b583c11b31171fec41032cf5bdde131.png" alt></p><p>Binary tree is widely used, and it permits both efficient access and update to large collections of data. Apart from organizing and searching, it is also applied for many things, like prioritizing jobs, describing mathematical expressions and the syntactic elements of computer programs, etc.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Properties"><a href="#Properties" class="headerlink" title="Properties"></a>Properties</h2><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/08/7722f93a9165c20a1d383b66ff886b6b.png" alt></p><p>This is a graph presenting a simple binary tree. The lines between nodes are called <code>edges</code>. Say $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_5$ is a sequence of nodes, and they are in an order from ancestor to descendant, then this sequence is called a <code>path</code> from $N_1$ to $N_5$. And the length of the path is the number of the edges in the path, which is, in this case, 2. The <code>depth</code> of a node in the tree is the length of the path from the root of the tree to the node itself. For instance, the node $N_4$ holds a depth of 2, while the $N_1$, the root of the tree, holds a depth of 0. The <code>height</code> of a node is 1 more than its depth.</p><p>The node without any child node which, in another word, has two empty children is called a <code>leaf</code> node. A node that has at least one non-empty child is called <code>internal</code> node.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Full-amp-Complete-Binary-Tree"><a href="#Full-amp-Complete-Binary-Tree" class="headerlink" title="Full &amp; Complete Binary Tree"></a>Full &amp; Complete Binary Tree</h3><p>A <code>full binary tree</code> is a tree in which each node is a internal node with two children or a leaf. A <code>complete binary tree</code> is a tree that each level of it is filled from left to right.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/09/d624bcafe56836d926b253b253a656a7.png" alt></p><blockquote><p>Theorem:</p><ol><li>The number of empty subtrees in a non-empty binary tree is one more than the number of nodes in the tree.</li><li>The number of leaves in a non-empty full binary tree is one more than the number of internal nodes.</li></ol></blockquote><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Binary-Tree-Traversals"><a href="#Binary-Tree-Traversals" class="headerlink" title="Binary Tree Traversals"></a>Binary Tree Traversals</h2><p>We will never use a data structure just for storing something, instead we definitely want to retrieve some of them later. For a binary tree, we sometimes just want to get access to a specific node. But in some cases, we may want to visit all nodes in order. There are 3 types traversals for a binary tree: <code>preorder</code>, <code>inorder</code>, and <code>postorder</code>. Literally, we can tell that the difference between them is the time when the root node of a tree or a subtree is visited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Preorder-Traversal"><a href="#Preorder-Traversal" class="headerlink" title="Preorder Traversal"></a>Preorder Traversal</h3><p>In preorder traversal, the root node of a tree or a subtree is the first node to be visited, prior to its left and right children. And then the left child node is visited, the right child node is the last one. When a preorder traversal is carried on, we first visit the root node of the tree, and if it has a non-empty left child, visit it. And next, we do the same thing to the subtree whose root node is this left child. Not until all the left nodes are visited, we start with the right ones.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/09/d16034a8470ca5010987ddffc94af60b.png" alt></p><p>So, the result of the preorder traversal on the above tree will be:</p><p>$$ ABDHIEJCFG $$</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Inorder-Traversal"><a href="#Inorder-Traversal" class="headerlink" title="Inorder Traversal"></a>Inorder Traversal</h3><p>In inorder traversal, the root of a tree or a subtree is the second node to be visited, right behind the left the child. When we carry on an inorder traversal, we first check if the root has a non-empty left child. If did, we don’t visit its left child but check it until we reach the most left child and visit this child. And then visit its parent, and check the left child of the parent’s right child and repeat. This may be a little bit confusing. If you don’t catch on, just read few more times along with the result:</p><p>$$  HDIBJEAFCG $$</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Postorder-Traversal"><a href="#Postorder-Traversal" class="headerlink" title="Postorder Traversal"></a>Postorder Traversal</h3><p>For now, the definition of postorder travsersal should be clear to you after going through the previous two traversals: visit a root after you complete visiting its left child and right child. If a root has a non-empty left child, we keep checking until we reach the most left child and visit it. Then do the same thing to the right child of the same level, and finally visited the parent. The corresponding result will be like:</p><p>$$ HIDJEBFGCA $$</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Binary-Tree-Node"><a href="#Binary-Tree-Node" class="headerlink" title="Binary Tree Node"></a>Binary Tree Node</h2><p>Finally the coding time!

class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Binary tree is a really tricky one compared to what we’ve went through before and it is widely used, so it is important for you to learn about it. This time we clarified some basic properties of binary tree and had a look at 3 types of the tree traversals. And in the end, we completed the node structure for our next challenge. The most difficult part for most of you may be the traversals. However, what I’m going to tell you is that it is not that hard to understand, and it will even be easier when we code them next time.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h2><p>[1] Data Structure &amp; Algorithm Analysis in C++ - Clifford A.

And what you have to know is that Unity editor extension is much more than this. When you start being involved, you may feel like lost and do not know what to do with that. It’s just fine, because you cannot create a custom editor just for a custom editor, you have to figure out what your game project needs. </p>]]></content>

      <title>Unity Editor Scripting#3 - Editor UI Groups</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>Last time, we went through some UI controls that can be applied in our custom editor window for specialized functionalities. And this time, we will go further to put up a more advanced technique: <code>Group</code>. This is a technique which allows us to organize a whole bunch of UI elements. For example, with automatic layout, Unity makes every button occupy a single line:</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/02/2d0bf4d9f87d71f654b9efa5d1ee263b.png" alt></p><p>By using a horizontal group, we can make these buttons evenly stand in the same line:</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/08/02/5f5023713c657cc2ae545e9c303b4d0a.png" alt></p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Intro-and-Usage"><a href="#Intro-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="Intro and Usage"></a>Intro and Usage</h2><p>Typically, the <code>Group</code> function consists of a beginning part, a ending part, and all the UI controls between them. The beginning part is mostly named <code>Beginxxx</code>, while the ending part is mostly named <code>Endxxx</code>. Same with UI controls, they are also static in the <code>EditorGUILayout</code> class.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="BeginHorizontal"><a href="#BeginHorizontal" class="headerlink" title="BeginHorizontal"></a>BeginHorizontal</h3><p><code>BeginHorizontal</code> is what used just now to make two buttons in the same line evenly. You can make anything in the same line, for instance, a button along with a text field, a text field along with a color picker, etc. You can even put 3 or more items together, but always pay attention to the window size. If you organize too many items in the same line and your window width is not enough, it will make it diffcult to identify them clearly.</p><pre class=" language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">ExampleWindow</span> <span class="token operator">:</span> EditorWindow<span class="token punctuation">{</span>    <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token function">MenuItem</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Window/Example Window"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span>    <span class="token keyword">static</span> <span class="token keyword">private</span> <span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">ShowWindow</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>        EditorWindow<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">GetWindow</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">typeof</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>ExampleWindow<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Example"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>    <span class="token keyword">private</span> <span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">OnGUI</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>        EditorGUILayout<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">BeginHorizontal</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>        GUILayout<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">Button</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Back"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>        GUILayout<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">Button</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Next"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>        EditorGUILayout<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">EndHorizontal</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="BeginFadeGroup"><a href="#BeginFadeGroup" class="headerlink" title="BeginFadeGroup"></a>BeginFadeGroup</h3><p><code>BeginFadeGroup</code> can make the area that contains a collection of UI items partially or completely faded.

The difference between them is mostly the use case. Simply saying, the <code>GUI</code> is used in the game scene to display UI items, while the <code>EditorGUI</code> is used in editor extension to display UI items in the custom window. When you use them, you have to manually adjust the layout of the UI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="GUILayout-vs-EditorGUILayout"><a href="#GUILayout-vs-EditorGUILayout" class="headerlink" title="GUILayout vs EditorGUILayout"></a>GUILayout vs EditorGUILayout</h2><p>We can regard these two as the wrappers of GUI and EditorGUI, the UI classes with automatic layout. It means you are able to create your UI more efficiently since you don’t have to adjust the layout manually. We will use <code>GUILayout</code> and <code>EditorGUILayout</code> in this chapter.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Intro-and-Usage"><a href="#Intro-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="Intro and Usage"></a>Intro and Usage</h2><p>The functions to create specific UI items in GUILayout and EditorGUILayout are static, so you can apply them by doing <code>GUILayout.xxx</code> or <code>EditorGUILayout.xxx</code>. More importantly, you have to make sure that you put all these functions witin <code>OnGUI</code> function which is responsible for UI rendering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="CurveField"><a

If you’ve coded like above and seen what happened in the Unity, you may noticed that we can interact with those UI controls, but they are not functional. This is because they are not connected with other stuff yet. Next time I will list some examples and continue to put up some advanced UI controls.

      <title>Computer Graphics Review#1 - Rendering Pipeline</title>
      <link href="/CG1-RenderingPipeline.html"/>
      <url>/CG1-RenderingPipeline.html</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>Rendering pipeline converts 3D scene into a 2D image phase by phase with given virtual camera, objects, light sources, textures, etc. We can generally divide it into 3 parts by order:</p><ul><li>Application stage</li><li>Geometry stage</li><li>Rasterization stage</li></ul><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/07/27/nr10M.png" alt></p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Application-Stage"><a href="#Application-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Application Stage"></a>Application Stage</h2><p>This stage is led by application and done by CPU. Tasks accomplished at this stage are below:</p><ul><li>Load the data from the hard drive into the CPU and do corresponding computations on the data, like collision detection.</li><li>Culling: discard all the objects that aren’t within the frustum and don’t intersect with the frustum.</li><li>Set up render states.</li><li>Draw call.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Notice:</p><ol><li>Render state defines that how a mesh should be rendered —— what shader to use, what material to apply, etc.</li><li>CPU and GPU work independently. How can they communicate? There is something called <code>command buffer</code>. CPU can push some orders into the buffer and GPU retrieve orders from the buffer. Draw call is one of the orders which makes the GPU start rendering a particular frame.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Finally, CPU assigns the primitive type and deliver the data of vertices to the GPU.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Geometry-Stage"><a href="#Geometry-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Geometry Stage"></a>Geometry Stage</h2><p>Geometry stage is a pipeline itself:</p><ol><li>Vertex shader.</li><li>Tesselation shader.</li><li>Geometry shader.</li><li>Clipping.</li><li>Viewport mapping.</li></ol><h3 id="Vertex-Shader"><a href="#Vertex-Shader" class="headerlink" title="Vertex Shader"></a>Vertex Shader</h3><p>Vertex shader is scriptable. It is used for transformations and vertex shading.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/07/27/nrbwe.png" alt title="Coordinate System From LearnOpenGL"></p><blockquote><p>Vertex shading is also called <code>Gourand Shading</code>. Get more information about it <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Basic-Lighting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>!</p></blockquote><p>As you see, this process is actually a serie of matrix computations. Vertex shader sequentially carrys on these computatioins on the vertices one by one, converting them from <code>object space</code> into <code>clip space</code>. As to the following part, in fact, they are not parts of vertex shader, OpenGL will help you with that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Clipping"><a href="#Clipping" class="headerlink" title="Clipping"></a>Clipping</h3><p>You may have noticed that the virtual camera can probably not cover a complete object through the whole transformation process. When this happens, the part outside the frustum will be discarded and then new vertices will be created. This takes place in the projection transformation process.</p><p><img src="https://ww1.yunjiexi.club/2019/07/28/nrprp.png" alt title="Clipping"></p><p>In more detail, when we convert the coordinates from view space into clip space, we have to define a <code>projection matrix</code>. This matrix determines a range of coordinates, for example, $(-1000, 1000)$. Then through the projection transfromation, the coordinates within the range will be mapped onto the <code>NDC (Normalized Device Coordinates)</code> in which the coodinates are within $(-1.0, 1.0)$. A vertex like $(1200, 400, 600)$ will not appear, because its $x$ component is out of range.</p><blockquote><p>Notice:<br>Clipping is kind of different from the culling we’ve mentioned. Culling is like a preprocess, and it discards the objects that are completely outside the frustum, while clipping reconstruct the objects that intersect with the frustum.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Viewport-Mapping"><a href="#Viewport-Mapping" class="headerlink" title="Viewport Mapping"></a>Viewport Mapping</h3><p>Once in the NDC, the <code>perspective division</code> is carried on. The $x$, $y$, $z$ components are divided by the homogeneous component $w$, and the 4D clip space coordinates are transform into 3D NDC coordinates. And then they are mapped onto screen space as fragments.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Rasterization-Stage"><a href="#Rasterization-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Rasterization Stage"></a>Rasterization Stage</h2><p>This stage goes through 3 sub-stages:</p><ul><li>Triangle Setup</li><li>Triangle Traversal</li><li>Fragment Shader</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Triangle-Setup"><a href="#Triangle-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Triangle Setup"></a>Triangle Setup</h3><p>The output from the preceding stage are daata of vertices, for a triangle, they are data of the 3 endpoints.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Triangle-Traversal"><a href="#Triangle-Traversal" class="headerlink" title="Triangle Traversal"></a>Triangle Traversal</h3><p>Triangle traversal is also called <code>scan conversion</code>. It checks if a pixel is covered by a triangle. If it is, then create a <code>fragment</code>. A fragment is something like a prototype of a pixel, which contains a bunch of data like depth and data from geometry stage. If a fragment is at an endpoint of the triangle, it contains the endpoint data, or its data come from interpolations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Fragment-Shader"><a href="#Fragment-Shader" class="headerlink" title="Fragment Shader"></a>Fragment Shader</h3><p>Use interpolated data as input, carry on corresponding shading computations pixel by pixel, like lighting, texture mapping, etc.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This is just an overview of rendering pipeline which mainly goes through some fundamental concepts without any code. Rendering pipeline is a core of computer graphics. It is what you have to know, if you want to be engaged in related fields, and I highly recommend you to study on <a href="https://learnopengl.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LearnOpenGL</a> which is a really good online OpenGL tutorial with both concepts and program guide.

It seems that this makes it less practical and less flexible than the lists, but it also makes it easy to implement and more efficient. We call this feature “LIFO” which stands for “Last-In, First-Out”. Simply, the insertion order goes reverse to that of removal.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Stack-ADT"><a href="#Stack-ADT" class="headerlink" title="Stack ADT"></a>Stack ADT</h2><p>Before we define a stack ADT, we have to make something clear. There is only one element in the stack accessible, that is the one on the top of the stack, which we call the <code>top</code> element. The insertion operation on a stack is called <code>push</code>. The removal operation is called <code>pop</code>. And it is worth noticing that we can just pop out the top element.</p><pre class=" language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp"><span class="token keyword">template</span> <span class="token

notice between these two implementations. That is the top element in a array-based stack is at the end of the array, while the top element in a linked stack is at the very beginning, although they are both called top element. This kind of design make it easier to implement pushing and popping for both.</li><li>The <code>Node</code> class has been defined last time.

The comparison of the total space requried is similar to the lists implementation: the array-based has to be predetermined and fixed, and the linked can flexibly adjust size but requires extra space for pointers.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h2><p>[1] Data Structure &amp; Algorithm Analysis in C++ - Clifford A.

It mathematically resembles set. Generally, all the data items in a list have the same type, but we do have some cases where different types of data items are in the same list.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Notice:</strong><br>The “ordered” here doesn’t mean that the list is sorted by value, it just means that every element in the list has a particular position instead.</p></blockquote><p>When a list contains no elements, we call it an <code>empty</code> list. The number of elements that are currently stored in the list is called <code>length</code> of the list. The beginning of the list is called <code>head</code>, while the end of the list is called <code>tail</code>.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="List-Operations"><a href="#List-Operations" class="headerlink" title="List Operations"></a>List Operations</h2><p>A list without any operations related to it is meaningless. Before we define a data structure implementation, we should first design some list operations. </p><p>Obviously, a list should be capable of extending and shrinking. For extending, we can simply append an element at the end of the list or insert an element at a particular position. For shrinking, we should remove an element and shift all the elements behind to the head direction. Additionally, we should be able to get access to all the elements in the list for the purpose of retrieving. Although these are just some basic operations, you are free to add some more to make your data structure versatile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="List-ADT"><a href="#List-ADT" class="headerlink" title="List ADT"></a>List ADT</h3><p>ADT is short for <code>abstract data type</code>. It is a realization of a data type as a software component. It contains the logic of data storing and some operations on the data. However, it is just an interface, which is separated from its corresponding implementation, making it possible for users to apply it simply without being stuck on the detail.</p><pre class="

their own pros and cons respectively. For array-based list, it is obvious that the size of it has to be predetermined and it is fixed. While with linked list, you can dynamically adjust the size of the list by inserting or removing nodes, however, it requires more space since a node has to store a pointer to the next node, except for the element. As to the time cost, the array-based list is more time-consuming when it comes to the inserting and removing, because the list has to resort all the elements following, which is not neccessary in the linked list.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Bye-Bye"><a href="#Bye-Bye" class="headerlink" title="Bye Bye"></a>Bye Bye</h2><p>The first part of the data structure is finished. I think it is a very good start and a beneficial warm-up for me, whose purpose is to learn and to get more familiar with data structure.

Welcome to Rhys’s!</p><p>I’m so glad that I finally manage to build my own blog, and I cannot wait to share with you guys all the interesting stuff. It is not easy for me to start writing blogs, since I am not so qualified and still have much to learn. But writing something and sharing and discussing them with others is also an awesome way to learn, isn’t it?</p><p>I really hope that you can get something new from Rhys’s, or just get inspired and come up with some new ideas from things that you’ve been learned about. If you have problems or catch some errors, you can get in touch with me through e-mail. I’m always a listener, a helper and a learner.</p><p>See ya!</p>]]></content>
